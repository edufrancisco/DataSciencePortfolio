# Data Science Portfolio by Francisco Eduardo
This repository contains some projects that I have worked in my Data Science journey. The projects are written in Python (presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks).<br><br>
<i>Note: Data used in projects are for demonstration purposes and derive from publicly accessible sources.</i>

## Projects
